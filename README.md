Power_Monitor
=============

Arduino and Processing sketches for Power Monitor Shield

*Boards v1r3 and v2r1 are not fully tested

This project is based on the work done by Christopher McNally.
Please view the Design_Report.pdf document for the write up of the project, and [website] (http://people.ece.cornell.edu/land/courses/eceprojectsland/STUDENTPROJ/2009to2010/csm44/index.html).

>The sample code was written for use with the 3000 Turn [CR Magnetics](http://www.crmagnetics.com/Products/CR3100-Series-P75.aspx) split core transformer. 

>If using the current transformer from [seeedstudio](http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/Noninvasive-AC-Current-Sensor-100A-max-p-547.html?cPath=25_28) then the code needs to be changed, as this is a 2000 turn transformer.
